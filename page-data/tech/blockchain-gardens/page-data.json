Built on the Ethereum backbone, Solstice FWD attendees participated in one of the first human blockchain experiments in history. Interactions and exchanges were recorded on the FWD ledger and the \"future of trust in a trustless world\" was on full display.","Blockchain Gardens is a real-time 3D visualization of a private Ethereum blockchain instance displayed at Solstice’s digital innovation summit.
